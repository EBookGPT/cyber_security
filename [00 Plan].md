This "Glitch" has the potential to grant complete control of the city's infrastructure to anyone who can exploit it.  Rei, wrestling with her own ethical compass and the looming threat of the Broker's vengeance, is torn between exposing the vulnerability to protect the city or using it to attain a semblance of justice for her parents' deaths.

* **Conflict:**  Rei, having discovered The Architect's true identity and his sinister plans to leverage the Glitch for his own twisted agenda, must make a final stand.
